kitty MP3player


Hi !

This is supposed to be a very lightweight and non bloated MP3 player. ( really most for previewing a song )


TODO list:

1.  make the File name appear in a better way,  Still dont wanna use ID3 tags, as the fileName is more important.

2.  get rid of the 3 buttons and make it Keyboard only ....

3.  add a songProgress bar.

4.  add playList support, (no priority)

5.  Make the fileName   bounce in RainBowColors to the bass of the music.


Volume control is not needed as it would bloat the GUI too much.
