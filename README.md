kitty MP3player
================


Hi !

This is supposed to be a very lightweight and non bloated MP3 player. ( really most for previewing a song )

=====================
USAGE
=====================

O = Open file.
P = Start Playback / Resume from Pause.
R = Return and play the song from the beginning.
S = Stop playback and close the current song.
F = FFW  (this function still work in progress)
Space key = Pause.



TODO list:
=============

DONE!  make the File name appear in a better way,  Still dont wanna use ID3 tags, as the fileName is more important.

DONE!  get rid of the 3 buttons and make it Keyboard only ....

3.  add a Song progress Counter.. maybe countUp in % ?

4.  add playList support, (no priority)

5.  Make the fileName   bounce in RainBowColors to the beat of the music.
